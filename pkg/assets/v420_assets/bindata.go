                If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
                than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique
                suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name
                field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to
                make the value unique on the server. \n If this field is specified
                and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 -
                instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout
                indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted,
                and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in
                the Retry-After header). \n Applied only if Name is not specified.

                a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
                from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in
                this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers
                list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp
                is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future,
                although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior
                to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted
                in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
                signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet
                will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and
                after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network
                partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until
                an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is
                fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has
                not been requested. \n Populated by the system when a graceful deletion

                in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
                signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet

                in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
                signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet
                will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and
                after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network

                resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful
                deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by
                a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
                from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in
                this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers
                list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp
                is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future,
                although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior
                to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted
                in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
                signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet
                will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and
                after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network
                partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until
                an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is
                fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has

                resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful
                deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by
                a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
                from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in
                this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers
                list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp
                is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future,
                although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior
                to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted
                in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
                signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet
                will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and
                after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network
                partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until
                an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is
